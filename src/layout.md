# Project: React Conference Website

This project aims to create a multi-page React website for a conference, providing event details, speaker information, schedule, and integrating a CMS for content management.

## Steps:

### Step 1: Initial Setup

- Use Create React App to initialize the project.
- Navigate to the project directory and install additional dependencies (e.g., React Router).

### Step 2: Homepage

- Create a `Homepage` component to display event details and set up React Router for page navigation.

### Step 3: Location Info Page

- Develop a separate `LocationInfoPage` component detailing the venue, accommodation, and transportation information.

### Step 4: Food Info Page

- Create a dedicated `FoodInfoPage` component listing available food options and local recommendations.

### Step 5: Code of Conduct

- Design a `CodeOfConductPage` component outlining event guidelines and contact information for reporting issues.

### Step 6: Speakers Section on Homepage

- Implement a `SpeakersSection` within the `Homepage` to showcase speaker details and talk schedules.

### Step 7: Schedule Page

- Create a `SchedulePage` component displaying a detailed event schedule with session descriptions.

### Step 8: Tailwind CSS Integration

- Integrate Tailwind CSS into the project for consistent styling across components and pages.

### Step 9: CMS Integration

- Choose and set up a CMS (Contentful, Strapi, etc.) for content management.
- Migrate content from React components to the CMS and source content dynamically.

### Step 10: Responsive Design & Testing

- Ensure responsiveness across devices using media queries or Tailwind's responsive classes.
- Test navigation, functionality, and content display thoroughly.

### Step 11: Final Refinements

- Polish UI/UX, ensuring design consistency and user interaction improvements.
- Verify content accuracy and completeness across all pages.

### Step 12: Deployment

- Choose a hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.) and deploy the React website for public access.

By following these steps, the goal is to create a user-friendly, informative, and responsive React conference website using Tailwind CSS for styling and a CMS for content management.
